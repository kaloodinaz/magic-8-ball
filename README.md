## Information
This was another project developed for fun. Making use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can find a working demo @ https://kaloodinaz.github.io/magic-8-ball/

For the best experience, make sure that your browser is up to date !

CSS was used for a majority of transitions and animations, and of course JavaScript is used for the main logic ! The answer triangles themselves are images, due to the fact that it's a bit difficult to maintain a perfect appearance with CSS alone. You can make triangles with 2 transparent borders and 1 colored, but I found it was still a difficult task. It should be achievable if you're using the canvas element, though. :)
